# KB-Agents

A Prolog-based knowledge agent system for intelligent conversation and controlled behavior through logical reasoning.

## Architecture

This project implements agents that use:
- **Rules**: Define behavioral logic
- **Facts**: Represent current state
- **Actions**: Determine next steps

The system is designed with clear separation between business logic and Prolog implementation through an AST/DSL abstraction layer.

## Development

See [.copilot/instructions.md](.copilot/instructions.md) for detailed development guidelines and architectural principles.
